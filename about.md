  Hey there! This page keeps my family and friends up to date with whatâ€™s going on in my day to day life. Itâ€™s all about how I manage my life with a very unusual type of cancer.
</p>

In many ways my life is simple. Every day is about having my life be filled with the best activities that make for the best of my health, happiness and success.

Iâ€™m also trying to learn how to manage this blog format on my [GitHub](github.com/aaronjlee/hyde). Iâ€™d love if you can teach me how to do it better.

## Feeling Good ðŸ˜Ž

Some fun facts about meâ€¦

* I love [fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?query=vernon+adams). (Please support the late [Vernon Adams](http://sansoxygen.com/).)
* GitHub is where I learn how to apply online visual communications [for free](https://aaronjlee.github.io/).
* [Vollkorn](http://vollkorn-typeface.com/) is my favorite German font because my random stem cell match is from Germany. Itâ€™s how I  celebrate.
* Looking for some good music advice. I havenâ€™t listened to anything good for ages.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to drop me a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aaronjlee).

Thanks for reading!
